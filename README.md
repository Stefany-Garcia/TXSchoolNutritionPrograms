# TXSchoolNutritionPrograms
This exploratory analysis was created as part of the CareerFoundry Data Analytics Course.

## Objective
Conduct an exploratory visual analysis in Python and finding connections between variables that seem worth exploring. After developing hypotheses, use various advanced analytical approaches to help test the hypotheses.

## Data
I sourced my data from data.texas.gov, Texas' Open Data Portal. The datasets contains claims information for paid or approved to pay meal reimbursement for sites participating in school nutrition programs. I primarily used data from the 2019-2020 school year and then introduced data from the 2020-2021 school year.
